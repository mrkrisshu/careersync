**Main User Flow:**
Users begin by registering and setting up their Gemini API key in Settings. They upload their base resume and paste a target job description in the Resume Builder. The AI analyzes both documents and generates a tailored resume optimized for the specific role. Users can then run ATS analysis to receive a compatibility score and improvement suggestions. They can generate a matching cover letter and track their application in the Job Tracker. The Analytics dashboard provides insights into their optimization progress and success patterns.

**Guest User Flow:**
Visitors can explore the landing page, view feature demonstrations, and access limited functionality before deciding to register for full access.
